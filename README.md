Hello! I'm a beginner developer creating Minecraft ports. I'm just starting out, so please don't be too critical ✨

![Project Preview](https://github.com/Artik9nx/KvotaWeb/blob/main/Res/Screenshot.png)

## 🚀 About the Project

This project is still pretty new, so I'm putting a lot of work into it 💪 I recently rebuilt Minecraft 4k Web, and now it's almost exactly like the original, but instead of a JavaApplet, it's implemented in **JavaScript** and **HTML** ✅

## 🙏 Gratitude

I wanted to give a huge shoutout to my friends:

- 🎯 SnowSans098
- 🎯 VladNiv
- 🎯 Uno228  
- 🎯 N.Software
- 🎯 Mezoik

## 💫 Support the Project

I'd really appreciate it if you could tell your friends and acquaintances about my project! 📣
